<p>
    Bangkok! We originally opened into this location due to the unique scenery and enviorment. We believed in ourselves and thus far have improved our skills. Bangkok gave us motivation and inspiration for most of our dishes. The owner used to eat all around Bangkok learning the unique style and cuisine of the locals and has expanded it into his own style. We now have four locations, that all are just as good and inviting as the origination of our chain.
